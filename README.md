## Description

### ☕ Welcome to CampHub - Your Ultimate Java-Based Camp Experience Management System! 🚀

### What is CampHub?
CampHub is not just a project; it's your comprehensive solution for managing, viewing, and registering for camps within NTU, all built on the robust foundation of Java. This dynamic application serves as a centralized hub for both staff and students, ensuring a smooth and delightful camp experience for all! 🌟

### 🌐 User-Centric Experience
CampHub prioritizes user convenience! Users log in using their NTU network user ID, with the default password set as "password." 🤖 Users can change their passwords within the system and even customize their profiles with faculty information.

### 🎓 Staff Features
Staff members enjoy a plethora of capabilities, including creating, editing, and deleting camps. The visibility toggle allows staff to control the accessibility of camps. They can view all camps, manage their own creations, and reply to student inquiries. Additionally, staff can generate comprehensive reports on camp attendance and committee performance. 📊

### 🚀 Camp Information
Each camp is detailed with essential information such as name, dates, registration closing date, user group accessibility, location, total slots, camp committee slots, description, and staff in charge. 📅

### 🎉 Student-Centric Features
Students can explore camps open to their user group, view remaining slots, and register as attendees or committee members. Enquiry submissions, registration management, and role reflection in profiles are seamless. Students earn flexibility with withdrawal options, but thoughtful restrictions prevent clashes and multiple registrations. 🧑‍🎓

### 🤝 Camp Committee Members
Committee members have additional privileges, from suggesting changes to camps and replying to student inquiries to generating insightful reports. Each activity earns points, fostering active engagement within the camp community. 🏆

### 🛠️ Built with Precision
CampHub is meticulously crafted with Java, ensuring functionality and adherence to programming best practices. The system initiates student and staff lists through file uploads during initialization. ☕
